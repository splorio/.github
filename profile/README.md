# Splorio

> Turn everyday moments into a growth map for your 2–7 year old.

Splorio is a parenting and preschool companion that blends child-development expertise with AI to help grown-ups understand a child’s temperament and support social-emotional growth in daily life.

No labels. No judgment. Just a clearer picture of the child you already love—and realistic ways to support them, week after week.

> **Note:** Splorio is an educational tool, not a medical device or therapy. It does **not** diagnose, treat, or provide crisis support.

## 🌱 What Splorio does

- **Maps “Goodness-of-Fit”**  
  Guided questionnaires for the child and caregivers generate a Goodness-of-Fit overview: where temperaments naturally *click* and where they tend to *clash*.

- **Turns everyday life into data (gently)**  
  Short check-ins plus optional 20–30 second video clips from natural moments (play, routines, transitions) are used to refine recommendations over time.

- **Builds weekly plans that actually fit real life**  
  5–15 minute activities for connection, regulation, and learning, matched to temperament and to how much time and energy caregivers genuinely have.

- **Provides in-the-moment support with AI**  
  An always-on companion that answers “what do I do now?” when big feelings, transitions, or tricky routines wobble.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 For families

Splorio for Parents is a personalised parenting guide designed for children aged **2–7 years**.

Caregivers can:

- Understand temperament across key traits (activity, sensitivity, adaptability, etc.)
- See where parent–child styles align or clash in everyday routines

## 🏫 For preschools

Splorio for Preschools adds a school-facing layer on top of the family experience.

Preschools get:

- **Family engagement views** – High-level insight into enrolment and usage trends across the community (no public ranking or comparison of individual children).
- **Low-lift implementation** – Parent onboarding, reminders, and technical support are centralised so teachers can stay focused on the classroom.
- **Curriculum-aligned language** – Activities and goals mirror core social-emotional skills already taught in class.
- **Shared space for home–school media** – A private channel for photos, notes, and short clips capturing real moments and milestones.
- **Teacher support** – Bite-sized learning resources plus an AI companion for quick, strengths-based ways to talk about behaviour and temperament.

The goal: help home and school respond in similar, sensitive ways so children experience consistency instead of mixed signals.

## 🧠 Principles

- **Child-first, context-aware** – The focus is on the child’s inner world and relationships, not on “fixing behaviour”.
- **Educational, not diagnostic** – Language and recommendations are strengths-based and avoid clinical labelling.
- **Privacy by design** – Data minimisation, secure storage, and clear consent flows are core design requirements; personal data is not sold.
- **Explainable support** – Wherever possible, caregivers see the logic behind recommendations in everyday language.

For details, please refer to the Privacy and Terms documents on our main site.
